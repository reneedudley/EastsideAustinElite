Bri believes CrossFit is more than just a place to workout….it’s a community that continually encourages everyone to challenge themselves physically, mentally and emotionally. Outside of the gym, Bri enjoys cooking, baking, hiking, time with family and friends, bacon, and anything involving the sunshine.

His future goals with CrossFit are to gain more certifications in Gymnastics, Kids, and Olympic lifting. He was introduced to CrossFit in 2012 but didn’t start actively training CrossFit until June 2013. His first competition was Nasty Girls at a local event back in February 2013. Just like any other person exposed to CrossFit, he was exhausted and had the adrenaline feeling during and after the WOD. He also enjoys the community aspect that CrossFit brings to every box. He believes that anything is possible when you work hard for it. In pursuit of being an instructor, he enjoys helping others to be better with life. Things outside the gym, he likes to have active rest days by running, road biking, kayaking, and paddle boarding out about Town Lake.
